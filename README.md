# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Get the value from the user for the number of rotation
### Step 4: 
Using the slicing concept rotate the list

### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: 
End the program. 
### PROGRAM:
```

x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(distance))
